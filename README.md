# Michael Paul Holidays Technical Test For Front End Developers

This is a simple Node.js server with Express framework which serves JSON data to an endpoint.

# Setup requirements
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine. Node.js comes with npm as an dependency, so if you install Node.js first this will install npm as well.

# Installation
First thing is to clone the project from BitBucket. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and clone the repository to your machine.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ajarzebowski/mph-front-end-test.git
```
After the project is cloned in your terminal navigate to the project folder
```sh
cd mph-front-end-test
```
Then install all npm dependencies by typing:
```sh
npm install
```
This will install all required files in node_modules folder.

# Run the project

To start the server from the project directory in the terminal run:
```sh
node app.js
```
and the server will start and will be listening on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


### Frameworks 

The project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
